Season 0 Card Minting and Deck Pulling Prompt for Game AI
Overview
This prompt defines the mechanics for minting and pulling Season 0 cards in the Gruda game, including tribe assignments, abilities, rare traits, and Supabase database integration. Cards are either minted individually or pulled from packs (3 cards per pack), with a total of 100,000 Season 0 cards and 100 unique Ethereal Signature cards. The system ensures proper randomization, rarity, and data storage.
Card Structure
Each card has:

ID: Unique identifier (1 to 100 for Season 0 cards).
Tribe: One of Iron Will, Blood For Conquest, Fabled, Tribal War, or Ethereal Signature (ultra-rare, pack-only).
Abilities: Tribe-specific ability plus optional new abilities (Haste, Give Allies +1 Attack, Double Strike, Stealth, Gold Shield).
Rarity Traits: Optional Rare Glyph or Legendary Foil, applied via random rolls.
Stats: Attack, Health, Mana Cost (base stats from season0.csv).
Visuals: Tribe-specific background, effects, and rare trait visuals.
Ownership: Linked to player’s wallet address.
Serial Number: Unique per card instance (e.g., 1/100,000).

Tribes and Abilities
Every card is assigned a tribe during minting or pack pulling. Ethereal Signature cards are pack-only, with only one instance per card ID (100 total). Tribe abilities and visuals are:

Minting Process for Player cards - made at mint tab

Player Input:  Player selects a attack and defense paying more GBuX for each added stat they can add taunt for 20 gbux and add +1 health to all allies on play for 20 GBuX
Player choses: a image to be his cards minion image by clicking UI requesting image
Hits Mint (system check for enough GBuX if enough take GBuX amount for Mint and continue)
Card Assignment: tribe (Iron Will, Blood For Conquest, Fabled, Tribal War; each 25% you cant roll a signature)
Creates a Unique ID number for this card to be used in batabase and for permenant ownership of that Unique to be assigned to player in Playercard to show ownership
Roll for new ability (10% per ability, max one).
Roll for rare trait (3% for Rare Glyph, 2% for Legendary Foil, max one).

Pack Pulling Process


Card Assignment:
For each card slot:
2% chance for Ethereal Signature (if available; max 1 per card ID globally supabase manages the packs purchased and cards opened).
Otherwise, randomly assign a tribe (24.5% each for non-Ethereal tribes).
Select random card ID (1-100).
Roll for new ability (10% per ability, max one).
Roll for rare trait (5% for Rare Glyph of fire, 5% for Rare Glyph of life, 5% for Legendary Foil, max one).

Pack Purchase: Player buys a pack for $GBuX, from pack tab receiving 3 cards face down with image https://i.imgur.com/nZgPzzk.png in shape of card, when clicked they rotate to reveal fully made card that has layered from furthers to closest on the ui background image of tribe is card outline and boarder and color (rest of images fit inside the background as that is the crds outline), rare trait image, card effects/animation, card info, minion/spell image, cost, attack, and health. so that we dont cover the things we need most


Duplicate Check: Same as minting; auto-sell duplicates.
Database Storage: Save all 3 cards to Supabase with there unique ID and add it to the 100,000 count.
Visuals: Display cards with tribe background, rare trait, ability image, cost, attack, health, cards text and name as final card they recieve then give it small visuals and animations (bouncing effect on reveal) 2 seconds. When all three are opened close the UI of the cards opening and save to supbaes player cards update deck pull from 100,000 update and signature update if it happened.

Supabase Database Schema
Store cards and player data in Supabase for real-time tracking. Tables and fields:
Table: cards

card_id: UUID (unique per card instance).
season0_id: Integer (1-100, references Season 0 card ID).
tribe: String (IronWill, BloodForConquest, Fabled, TribalWar, EtherealSignature).
owner_wallet: String (player’s wallet address).
serial_number: Integer (1 to 100,000, unique per card instance).
attack: Integer (base attack from season0.csv).
health: Integer (base health, +2 if Legendary Foil).
mana_cost: Integer (from season0.csv).
has_haste: Boolean (default: false).
has_allies_boost: Boolean (default: false).
has_double_strike: Boolean (default: false).
has_stealth: Boolean (default: false).
has_gold_shield: Boolean (default: false).
has_rare_glyph: Boolean (default: false).
glyph_ability: String (null if no glyph, e.g., “regenerate”).
has_legendary_foil: Boolean (default: false).
created_at: Timestamp (mint/pull time).

Table: players

wallet_address: String (primary key).
gbux_balance: Integer (tracks $GBuX for minting/packs).
owned_cards: Array of UUIDs (references cards.card_id).

Table: ethereal_signature_tracker

season0_id: Integer (1-100, primary key).
is_minted: Boolean (true if pulled, false otherwise).
owner_wallet: String (null if not minted).

Implementation Details

Randomization: Use a cryptographically secure RNG for tribe, ability, and trait rolls to ensure fairness, and to assign each card a crypto ID that makes ownership go to wallet given to player
Ethereal Signature LimitsFactors: Check ethereal_signature_tracker to enforce one-per-ID limit. If all 100 are minted, exclude from pulls never make a 2 signautre cards of same ID globally.
Duplicate Handling: Query cards table for season0_id and tribe matches per owner_wallet. If found, credit $GBuX and skip storage.
Animations: Apply Solitaire-like bounce (random speed, edge collision) on mint/pull. Use tribe-specific effects (e.g., red glow, butterfly lights) and rare trait visuals (foil overlay, glyph).
UI: Display cards in Library tab as card unique id (with background, rare image, effects, minion/spell image, cost, attack, health, text), borders are tribe color, and stats (serial number is middle right of card small print). 
Show “Buy” for unowned cards in library purchaesd cards only recieve a random tribe never a rare, signature, or ability added.
Total Cards: Track 100,000 card limit via cards table count. Stop minting/pulling when reached.

Error Handling

Insufficient $GBuX: Reject mint/pack purchase if players.gbux_balance is too low.
Database Failure: Retry Supabase writes up to 3 times; log errors for admin review, dont take gbux
Invalid Card ID from packs: Ensure season0_id is 1-100; reject out-of-range values.

Example Workflow

Mint:
Player can choes image from there local files to have as image for cards minion image area
Player selects  attack and health, pays 10 $GBuX per stat.
Player selects  given abilities taunt or/and +1 heal for 20 Gbux each
Assign card ID Crypto hash, Unique id for made by players wallet number
Roll: Rolls ability (10% to get one) Rolls rare (3% for Rare Glyph, 2% for Legendary Foil, max one)
Check: No duplicate ID and Tribe in a players deck pay player and remove it if it happens then Save pack pulled cards, provide flickering, bounce animation


EXAMPLE -
Pack Pull:

Player buys pack for 100 $GBuX, Supabaes identifies user checks for 100 removes the 100 and give a pack of 3 cards.
Card 1: Fabled, ID 17, Double Strike, Rare Glyph (scry 2).
Card 2: Blood For Conquest, ID 83, no extra ability, Legendary Foil.
Card 3: Ethereal Signature, ID 95, no extra ability/trait.
Check: No duplicates. Save to cards, update ethereal_signature_tracker for ID 95.
Display with respective visuals and animations.



This ensures a robust, fair, and visually engaging card system for Gruda Season 0, with proper database integration and rarity enforcement.
